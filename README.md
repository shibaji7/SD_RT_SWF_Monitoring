# Solar Flare & SWF Monitoring

> The X-ray, Extreme Ultra Violate (EUV) radiation released during a solar X-ray flare induces electron density enhancement in the dayside D-region ionosphere[^1]. This heightened electron density has the capacity to elevate absorption in the high frequency (HF:3-30 MHz) range, specifically between 3 and 30 MHz. The consequence is a reduction in signal strength, affecting shortwave radio transmissions, commonly known as shortwave fadeout, SWF.

> This monitoring tool provides a summary of flare impacts on SuperDARN HF radar observations in the North American sector with an emphasis on ShortWave Fadeout (SWF). Specifically, tool provides the following data/analysis products:
> * *Event-based Summary Reports*: Pre-loaded events by [calender](flarelist.html), shwoing solar irradiance (at X-ray band) condition and associated ionospheric/HF response recoreded by SuperDARN.
> * *New HF absorption model*: Pre-loaded modeled events by [calender](newdrap.html), shwoing solar irradiance (at X-ray band) condition and modeled HF condition during the peak of the flare.

### Event-based Summary Reports

> Summary report of GOES X-Ray irradiance. Flare class and peak time is identified in the Soft X-ray sepctrum (SXR, red). Summary report of a sub-network of SuperDARN radar chain distributed across the middle and high-latitudes of the North American Sector. SWF phase timings [onset, blackout, recovery start, and end] and phase durations [onset, backout, and recovery] are estimated from the backscatter count `<E>` parameter. Thresholds and alogorithm is defined in Chakraborty et al. (2018)[^2]. Please find example event and parameter description in this [webpage]().

### New HF Absorption-Model:

> Latest study by Fiori et al. (2022)[^3] optimized a simple absorption model using data from solar X-ray flares and riometer stations across Canada. In a specific event study, our optimized model showed a 1% overestimation of absorption during an X2.1 solar X-ray flare, correcting an underestimation by the NOAA D-region Absorption Prediction (D-RAP) model. In a broader statistical study involving 87 events, event-by-event optimization demonstrated excellent agreement between measured and modeled data, with a Pearson correlation coefficient (R) of 0.88 and a slope (m) of 0.91. The study also developed a generalized model using data from all events, showing slightly reduced correlation (R = 0.75) and slope (m = 0.80). The model's accuracy, evaluated by prediction efficiency, peaked at 0.78 for event-by-event analysis and 0.48 for the collective dataset. This new HF absorption model is also presented along with DRAP[^4] [^5] [^6] [^7] model output. Please find example event and parameter description in this [webpage]().
