            <p>
                This comprehensive report provides an illustrative example of an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X5</code> solar flare event that reached its peak at 21:55 UT on December 12, 2023. 
                The top left panel offers insight into the solar zenith angle conditions over the region of interest, i.e., the North American sector, precisely during the flare peak (mentioned in UT and CST). 
                This contextual information is crucial for understanding the spatial aspects of the flare event over North American sector along with the Fields-of-View (FoV) of the radars under consideration.

                In the middle panel, a detailed time series of X-ray irradiance from the GOES satellite is presented. 
                This graphical representation allows for a dynamic visualization of the intensity of X-ray emissions throughout the duration of the solar flare. 
                The X-ray irradiance data is essential for gauging the magnitude and potential impacts of the solar event. 
                Flare start, peak, and end times are identified by $F_s$, $F_p$, and $F_e$ respectively. 
                Flare class and solar active region (flare source) is also mentioned in top left corner.
            </p>

            <p>
                The bottom panel of the report features a time series of SuperDARN ground scatter, providing a real-time depiction of ground scatter observations during the solar flare. 
                SuperDARN ground scatter data (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">E</code>) is invaluable for understanding the ionospheric response and any disturbances induced by the solar flare in the Earth's upper atmosphere.
                Onset, blackout start, end and recovery times are identified by O, <math display="block"><mrow>B_s</mrow></mrow></math>, $B_e$, and $R$ respectively.
                In all the cases time are in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UT</code>. 
                For reference figure provide <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">US/Central</code> local time.

            <p>
                Together, these panels offer a holistic view of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X5</code> solar flare event, combining solar zenith angle conditions, X-ray irradiance data, and SuperDARN ground scatter observations. 
                This report serves as an exemplary showcase, highlighting the interconnectedness of solar events, their impact on the ionosphere, and the observational tools used to monitor and analyze such phenomena.
